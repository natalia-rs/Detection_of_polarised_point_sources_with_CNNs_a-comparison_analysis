# Abstract
The detection and subtraction of point sources in the microwave sky are of paramount significance in cosmology, as they enable precise characterisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background and facilitate the measurement of the cosmological parameters. This study conducts a comparative analysis of point source detection in Cosmic Microwave Background polarisation data using Convolutional Neural Networks. The detection will be performed for different observables: Stokes parameters, E and B mode decomposition maps, and polarisation intensity. To train the Convolutional Neural Network, simulations will be employed, replicating the essential instrumental characteristics of the forthcoming ground-based Simons Observatory. This research evaluates the predictions generated by our Convolutional Neural Network under two distinct scenarios: one lacking Galactic foreground contamination and another in its presence. Among the polarisation representations, EB and B emerge as top performers in foreground-free conditions, while B is superior when foregrounds are included. This work shows how Convolutional Neural Networks can serve as a powerful tool for point source detection, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations across diverse polarisation representations.

# Steps to run the code:
1. Generate the flux values and the number of point sources for the training dataset, located in TFM/Training data/Number_Counts/Src/Flux_Density_Distribution.ipynb
2. Simulate the CMB signal, the noise and the point sources for the different polarisation maps for the training dataset, along with the labels map, located in TFM/Training data/Simulation/Simulation_27GHz.ipynb
3. Divide the polarisation training maps into patches in TFM/Training data/Patching/Patching_training.ipynb
4. Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 for another simulated map -*Observation map*- in TFM/Observation data
5. Generate the simulated foreground maps and patch them in TFM/Foreground data
6. Run the CNN network for a polarisation representation, for example, start with B, which is in TFM/models/B/B_CNN.ipynb. Repeat the process for all of the polarisation representations
7. Go to the *Analysis* folder inside each polarisation representation and run the scripts *Metrics* and *Metrics_foregrounds* to obtain the completeness and reliabilities for all thresholds
8. You can also obtain a visualisation for the patches containing the brightest point sources for the different maps in TFM/models/B/Analysis/Brightest_PS_patches_foreg.ipynb
9. Compare the metrics for the different polarisation representations in TFM/models/All observables metrics
10. In TFM/More plots you can obtain several useful visualisations, such as point source sky distribution, point source appearance or point source predictions for the 5th, 100th and 500th brightest point source
