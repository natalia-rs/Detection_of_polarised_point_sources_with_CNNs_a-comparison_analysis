# Abstract
The detection and subtraction of point sources in the microwave sky are of paramount significance in cosmology, as they enable precise characterisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background and facilitate the measurement of the cosmological parameters. This study conducts a comparative analysis of point source detection in Cosmic Microwave Background polarisation data using Convolutional Neural Networks. The detection will be performed for different observables: Stokes parameters, E and B mode decomposition maps, and polarisation intensity. To train the Convolutional Neural Network, simulations will be employed, replicating the essential instrumental characteristics of the forthcoming ground-based Simons Observatory. This research evaluates the predictions generated by our Convolutional Neural Network under two distinct scenarios: one lacking Galactic foreground contamination and another in its presence. Among the polarisation representations, EB and B emerge as top performers in foreground-free conditions, while B is superior when foregrounds are included. This work shows how Convolutional Neural Networks can serve as a powerful tool for point source detection, providing valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations across diverse polarisation representations.
